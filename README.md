# Introduction
The Abacus-8 computer is a minimalist 8-bit computer, built and simulated in Logisim-Evolution. A total of 19 instruction is designed around the CISC (complex instruction set computer) architecture, minimizing register count and focuses more on accessing memory for every instructions. As a result, the AX (accumulator) and PC (program counter) are the only registers available for user to modify. Means of interfacing are accomplished via 7-segment LED display + driver attached to every registers and counters; inputting new programs are only done by uploading hexfile (imagefile) to RAM.
